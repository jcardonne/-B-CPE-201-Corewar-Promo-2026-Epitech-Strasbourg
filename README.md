# [B-CPE-201] Corewar - Promo 2026 - Epitech Strasbourg

## Description
Back in the good old days...

Corewar is a game. A very special game. It consists of pitting little programs against one another in a virtual
machine.
The goal of the game is to prevent the other programs from functioning correctly by using all available
means.
The game will, therefore, create a virtual machine in which the programs (written by the players) will face
off. Each program’s objective is to “survive”, that is to say executing a special instruction ("live") that means
I’m still alive. These programs simultaneously execute in the virtual machine and in the same memory zone,
which enables them to write on one another.
The winner of the game is the last one to have executed the "live" instruction.
